Package: ltools
Title: Helper Functions
Version: 0.5
Authors@R: "Leah Comment <leah.comment@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: An assortment of functions which I found myself repeatedly
    copying and pasting from homework to homework and project to project.
    Mostly related to tasks found in early-stage graduate work in statistics
    or another field with lots of data analysis.  Also a way to keep track
    of which packages my favorite Bayesian functions (e.g., riwish) come from.
    Increasingly, it includes functions useful for multiple research projects.
